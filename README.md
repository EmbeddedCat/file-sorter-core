# Introduction

Welcome to sushi-shuffle, your new ally in conquering the chaos of file organization. This lightweight and flexible service is designed to rescue your files from the abyss of disorder, operating seamlessly based on a straightforward config file. Imagine giving specific orders to your file-sorter like â€“ "Hey, check /home/username/Desktop/, and if you find any *.py files, move them to /home/username/py!" It's that simple.

# Installation Requirements

Before diving into the sushi-shuffle fun, make sure to install the necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git gcc
```

# Download & Build

Get started by cloning the repository and navigating to the File-Sorter-Core folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/constarg/sushi-shuffle.git
cd sushi-shuffle/
```
Now, let's build the program:

```
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../
make
make install
```

`
Make sure your cmake version is 3.19 or above. If not, grab the latest version from here: https://cmake.org/download/
`

After this the program will be installed and ready to run.

# Config
Customize your sushi-shuffle experience using the config file located at ~/.local/share/sushi-shuffle/config/config.conf. Set check intervals, debug modes, default paths, and more. The config file has three segments: [check], [targets], and [exclude], allowing you to define locations, file extensions, and rules effortlessly.
